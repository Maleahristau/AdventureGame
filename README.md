## Logline: 
Grocery Hunt, is a text based adventure, where you are tasked to get the items from the store. Each aisle has a different item and a new character to navigate. So take your time and hold back a laugh as you try to pick up a few things in this wacky adventure in Grocery Hunt!


## List of Items to collect

#### Eggs - Located in aisle 2, granted when you pick asking the man to move once again.

#### Milk - Located in aisle 1, granted when you pick strawberry.

#### Toilet paper - Located in aisle 3, granted once when you enter the aisle.

#### Banana - Located in aisle 4, granted when you pick strawberries.


## List of Endings

All ending will be displayed at checkout and will have a receipt with a list of what they bought from the store that will update depending on what they collected.

If the player collects one of each item, (Bananas,Eggs, Milk and Toilet Paper) they will be told they have the true ending “One of a kind”.

If the player collects more than 10 items, (Bananas,Eggs, Milk and Toilet Paper(Tp can only be collected once)) of any type the player will get the poor ending where they leave because they can’t afford all the items.

If the player gets no items, and goes right to the checkout the player will get the failure ending. The player will be sent home with nothing to show for their trip. They will be disappointed and there will be no receipt.

#### There’s two endings not related to the checkout

If a player says Chocolate to the women deciding on which milk to buy they will die from the woman's indecisiveness. (isle 1)

If the player chooses to tap the round gentlemen they will trip and fall onto him causing the player to be sent to jail for murder, ending their shopping trip early.
